# V.1.3.1 - Database Changes & Tooltip Hot Fix
*Deployed 12/21/2020*

## CHANGES
- Worked on some tool tips for the Dungeon Phase. Positioning is a bit messy, I'll clean it up in the next small release sometime in January 2021.

- Saving your progress is now up to you. The game no longer auto saves frequently, which will increase the amount of people able to play the game per day based on Database restrictions with Google Firebase.

## BUG FIXES
- Fixed a leaderboard breaking bug where the players score was persisting between character deaths, allowing one dedicated player *CRASHDADDY* to amass a score of over 200,000

- Fixed issue where saved game data would appear on the Saved Game/Main Menu screen despite not actually existing.


# V.1.3.0 - Quality of Life Changes and Gameplay Changes
*Deployed 12/18/2020*

## BIG CHANGES
- Varlet and Mage Special Abilities have changed!
   - Mage's Variagate ability now halves the monsters health (rounding up) at time of use. Can be stacked. A Monster with 10 HP will be reduced to 5, then to 3, then to 2 after three complete uses. Variagate works best on monsters with a lot of health.
   - Varlet's ability has changed to deal 1/4 your max attack score (rounding up). If your ability kills a monster, you'll gain 1 extra coin along with the coins gained for defeating the monster.
- Attack Roll randomization is more consistently middle of the road. The RNG (Random Number Generation) for attack was too random, and Iâ€™ve made it more consistently roll towards the middle between 1 and your highest possible damage.

## AUDIO CHANGES
- Remixed and mastered all audio for the game using conditional volumes for Howler to make the audio less varied and entire audio experience enjoyable.

## GENERAL CHANGES
- Added a Tool Tip Component to improve gameplay help for new players. Hovering over certain things will now provide context clues. Try it out! I'll be adding more as I improve the game.
- Added a setting cog to the Login Bar, for now you can use this to change your preferences for using tooltips which will help newcomers learn how to play the game. More settings will be available as the game improves and updates.
- New hovertext for character portraits in the dungeon phase.
- Fixed issue with armor icon not appearing during Swordsman En'garde
