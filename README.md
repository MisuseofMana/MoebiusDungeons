## Moebius Dungeons is an Expirement in Vue.js 
Moebius Dungeons was developed as an expiriment while completing my Full Stack Certification from Austin Coding Academy. Over the course of 2020 the game took on many different iterations as my full stack comprehension grew. Moebius Dungeons started as a Javascript/Jquery, HTML, and CSS project without any framework, toggling between game phases using Jquery displays and tracking information in a simple Json Tree.

Scaling up and looking ahead to what I wanted the game to become I realized quickly I was outgrowing the scope of what just JS/Jquery, HTML, and CSS alone could do for me. 

Here's a little gif of the difference in UI when I upgraded to using Vue.js. The interface became much cleaner and more organized with the modularity that Vue.js Framework offered with it's reusable Components.
